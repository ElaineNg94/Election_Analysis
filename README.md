**Election-Audit Summary**
-
This script can be used for any election with some modifications to the code. One of the modifications could be having categories for mail-in votes and in-person votes. This should be added to the code because mail-in ballots might not be received by the day of the election. Another modification to the code could be to consider the political party preference. The smaller counties might have a different political party preference from the bigger counties because their lifestyle is different from bigger counties.
